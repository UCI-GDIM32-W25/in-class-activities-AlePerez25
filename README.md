# Activity 2
Q1: 10


Q2: 2


Q3: Print “hello world” in the console every frame


Q4: MonoBehavior


Q5: Print “x = 10” in the console when the program starts


Q6: The “(10)” is the integer assigned to show along with the text “x = ” together that's why we need to use the “+” sign to display “x = 10”


Q7: The _playerTransform variable is instantiated but never used.


Q8: “Transform” is without capital “T”. Correct code =  “transform.translate”


Q8: Transform.Translate should be replaced with _playerTransform.Translate.
