### Activity 2
- In today's class, I worked on my mini-game 2, creating the game objects, configuring the inspector for each of them, and writing a small portion of the code to make my penguin jump. This worked, but the problem is that if I continuously press the spacebar, my penguin flies because it performs a double jump. I need to fix that. I also created the other scripts, but I haven't worked on them yet.
